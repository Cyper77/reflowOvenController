ESTechnical Reflow Oven Controller source code

Important
====================

This branch is solely for use on controllers with MAX31855KASA+ ICs that are affected by the issue described here: http://www.estechnical.co.uk/blog/entry/we-discovered-a-fault-with-estechnical-reflow-controllers

Using this firmware on non-affected controllers will give poor results.

Introduction
====================

The ESTechnical reflow oven controller was designed to operate the T962, T962A and T962C ovens.

It operates using PID control of the heater and fan output to improve the control compared to the original manufacturer's controller.

ESTechnical sell the controller hardware ready to install on eBay and on the ESTechnical website: http://www.estechnical.co.uk

Thanks go to Toby Wilkinson for his excellent menu codebase - http://tobestool.net/t962-t962a-reflow-oven-controller/
Thanks are also due to Brett Beauregard for his excellent work on the arduino PID library - http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIDLibrary


Obtaining the source code
====================

Use one of the following methods to get the source code:

Using GIT:
If you are familiar with git and want to use git to check out the source code, use the following command in a terminal:
(This will check out the source code from git into the current directory. I will cover no further use of git here.)

	git clone https://github.com/estechnical/reflowOvenController.git


Downloading a zip file:
	To download a zip file of the latest source code, visit https://github.com/estechnical/reflowOvenController and click on the
	'Download ZIP' button (in the right hand column of the page). Once the file has dowloaded, extract the zip archive to a location of your choice.


Installation
====================

To edit/compile the source code for the reflow controller, first install the arduino IDE - http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Because the ESTechnical reflow controller uses a 20MHz crystal instead of a 16MHz crystal, this requires special build settings for the arduino IDE. 

Browse to your arduino installation directory, then browse to hardware/arduino/boards.txt. Edit this file (using, for example Programmer's Notepad http://www.pnotepad.org) and add the following block to the top of the file, taking care to not mess up the layout of the file:

Save the file and quit.

Setting up the source code to build firmware
====================

Locate the sketchbook directory that the arduino IDE created when installing, you can see the path to your sketchbook folder in the arduino preferences menu (File-> Preferences).

From the files downloaded and unzipped from github:

Copy the ReflowController directory from the zip file into the Sketchbook directory. 

Copy all the directories in the Libraries directory to the libraries directory in the arduino sketchbook directory.

Open the arduino IDE, open the ReflowController.pde sketch (using File->Open). 

Select the right kind of hardware from the Tools->Board menu. 

Compile the firmware with Ctrl+R to test everything is installed correctly. Choose the right serial port from Tools->Serial Port and then upload the code using Ctrl+U.
